This diagram depicts an AWS State Machine workflow consisting of the following components:

The workflow starts with a "Start" state.

The first step is a Lambda function named "CreatePrompt". This function is likely responsible for generating or retrieving a prompt or input data for the subsequent step.

The second step is a Bedrock service named "InvokeModel". This service likely invokes a machine learning model, potentially using the prompt generated by the previous step as input.

The data flow indicates that the output from the "InvokeModel" step is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Finally, the workflow reaches an "End" state, signifying the completion of the process.

The overall architecture suggests a serverless workflow where a Lambda function prepares input data, which is then passed to a Bedrock machine learning service. The output from the machine learning model is stored in an S3 bucket for further processing or retrieval. This architecture leverages AWS serverless services like Lambda and Bedrock to build a scalable and event-driven machine learning pipeline.
