This architecture diagram depicts an AWS Lambda function that interacts with Amazon Bedrock. The flow is as follows:

A client or event triggers the Lambda function.
The Lambda function executes its code, which likely involves interacting with Amazon Bedrock.
After interacting with Bedrock, the Lambda function completes its execution and returns a response or performs any necessary follow-up actions.
This architecture leverages the serverless nature of Lambda functions and Amazon Bedrock, enabling efficient and secure application deployment and management on AWS.
