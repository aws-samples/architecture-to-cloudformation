Here is a step-by-step description of the AWS architecture diagram:

The client application uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket. This triggers an "ObjectUploaded" event.

The ObjectUploaded event invokes an AWS Lambda function via an Amazon S3 event notification configuration, likely using the .csv extension as the event source mapping.

The Lambda function processes the uploaded object and saves its metadata to an Amazon DynamoDB table.

The architecture leverages AWS Lambda as a serverless computing service, allowing code to run without provisioning or managing servers.

Amazon S3 serves as a highly scalable and durable object storage service, acting as the entry point for the data flow.

DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service, stores the metadata extracted from the uploaded objects, enabling efficient querying and retrieval.
